# excel2Python
a super cool script that allows one to read in colomn data from a .xlsx ( Excel ) file !!!!!

As a physics student I perfered using excel for data entery and manipulation, but matlibplot has the superior data plotting.
So this module is meant to be a nice interface for grabbing column data from excel in python very easily!

TODO:

add more features? cant think of any but if they come up I will add
add comments
add more documentation for how to use
